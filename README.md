# Skaumenn-App
Made by: Tobias Reidarsen, jonny5203, and Odd Eirik Hjelmeland Nes.
A app to register bites and sightnings of Ticks (a parsite), and wether or not you got sick from it.
Also has a section for information on Ticks (no guarantee for it being accurate). 
Warning: Does not work anymore. All API keys have been turned off.
